Xamarin vs Firebase

Xamarin
-------

	Pros: 
	-Uses the C# language based on .NET framework
	-The performance metrics are comparable to those of Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift
	-Xamarin.Android & Xamarin.iOS provide native-like experiences for the user
	-Xamarin SDK is open-source
	-Xamarin.Forms allows for the protoyping of apps to be more integrated
	-Code sharing between platforms is very easy

	Cons:
	-Delayed support for the latest technologies released by Android and iOS (as with all non-native languages)
	-Limited access to open source libraries
	-Xamarin community members are little, so its difficult to find a community to aid with issues like stack overflow
	-Larger app size due to associated libraries, content, Mono runtime, and Base Class Library (BCL) assemblies
	-Compatibility isues with third party services
	-Very buggy and requires constant rebuilding


Native App Development
----------------------

	Pros:
	-Uses languages we are familiar with, Java and Swift
	-Up to date technologies
	-Performence metrics very high
	-Libraries fully up to date

	Cons:
	-No code sharing and application must be developed twice
	-Developing in swift recquires learning a new language plus investing in a mac
